# Mobile-Only Artworks Online-Shop

Welcome to this demo of a Mobile-Only Multiple Pages Application that showcases an online-shop selling artworks. 

## Background
This project was originally crafted as a demo for an artist client. The unique approach of this project was to limit the accessibility of the website to mobile devices only. While it may be seen as a controversial decision, it was to demonstrate the options available to the client.

**Note**: The project might not consistently adhere to best practices due to its demonstration nature.

## Features

- **Fully Functional**: Despite being a demo, the online-shop is fully functional. 
- **Interactive**: Feel free to:
  - Add or remove products from the cart.
  - Modify quantities.
  - Follow the guidelines to validate a sale with Stripe in the test version.

## Testing Payments

The shop is integrated with Stripe in the test mode. You can follow the provided guidelines to simulate transactions and explore the complete purchase process.

## Feedback

Any feedback or contributions to enhance the functionality or the codebase are welcome!
